# Intro

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at [The University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/), currently working as an administrative assistant at [Huza Law Office](https://lawcornwall.com). I am in the process of applying to law school to further my passion for becoming a lawyer, with a particular focus on litigation and human rights issues. My experience at Huza Law Office has allowed me to develop valuable skills client communication, case management, organization, time management, and attention to detail, which have all deepened my commitment to the study of law.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy reading, going to the gym, investing, and exploring diverse topics such as [LLMs (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model), space, and computer science. Please feel free to [reach out](http://holtzz.com/contact) if you would like to connect.

# Some History Highlights

- May 19, 2003: My mother gave birth to me at the Lakeshore General Hospital in Montreal. I was a decent sized baby, weighing in at 7 pounds.
- 2.5 years old: My first of two brothers, Jeffrey, was born.
- 5 years old: My youngest brother, Marc, was born.
- 7 years old (2010): My father got me my first computer, sparking my fascination with technology.
- From 8 to 10 years old (2011-2013): My dad took me to museums and music shows, deepening my interest in space, science, and music.
- 10 years old (2013): I got a new [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) and started working on all sorts of projects.
- 11 years old (2014): I began reading more on my own, expanding my curiosity in a range of topics like fantasy, philosophy, thrillers, sci-fi, and horror.
- 12 years old (2015): i built my first website using HTML, marking the start of my web development journey.
- 13 years old (2016): I began watching law shows like Law & Order and Boston Legal with my dad, sparking my interest in law.
- 14 years old (2017): I started learning more about computer science and programming as well as playing chess.
- From 14 - 16 years old (2017-2019): I built my first computer, began listening to podcasts, and further developed my chess skills, creating a passion for the game.
- 16 years old (2019): I began volunteering at Lalonde's Body Shop on weekends. I learned a lot about the car industry and auto body work, which has remained very valuable to me.
- From 17 to 18 years old (2020-2021): COVID-19 took over the world, and my family opted me in for asynchronous learning. I took this as an opportunity to complete all my high school early so that I could volunteer more and work full time instead of part time to be fully prepared for university.
- 18 years old (2021): I graduated from high school and started my undergraduate degree in Psychology at the University of Ottawa. My interest in understanding people - how they think, feel, and why they do the things they do was one my key motivators in choosing this field of study.
- 2022: Mr. Lalonde retired, and I moved to Ottawa for my second year of university.
- May 2023: I began volunteering for Huza Law Office, which shared the same building at the time. I met Victor Lestyan the firm's litigator; he is the reason my interest in litigation solidified.
- July 2023: I was hired by Mr. Huza and he told me that he saw a bright future ahead of me.
- Present day: I'm completing my final year of my undergrad and I have completed my application to law school.

This is a brief overview of my journey so far. There’s so much more to my story.
